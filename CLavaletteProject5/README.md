# Stack Generator

## Description
This Java application generates a sorted stack based on user input. 
The program prompts the user for the number of elements and their values, 
sorts the stack, and then prints the sorted elements. 
This program represents a maintenance task executed upon **CSC6301CLavaletteProgrammingAssignment4**. 
Modifications were made to variables, methods, print statements, and the `LinkedListGenerator` class. 
The items were refactored to replace "linked list" with "stack." 
The `java.util.Stack` class was imported rather than `java.util.LinkedList`.
